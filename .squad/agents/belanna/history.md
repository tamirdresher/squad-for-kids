### 2026-05-11: Azure DevOps MCP Multi-Org Limitations

**Context:** Issue #329 — Squad couldn't access PRs in different Azure DevOps orgs (microsoft vs msazure).

**Key Findings:**
1. **Single-Org Constraint**: The `@azure-devops/mcp` package requires org name as a startup argument and cannot switch orgs at runtime
2. **No Runtime Reconfiguration**: MCP servers must be restarted with a new org argument to switch orgs
3. **Config Hierarchy**: Repo-level `.copilot/mcp-config.json` doesn't override global MCP server instances. Global config takes precedence for server definitions.
4. **Auth Method**: Uses Entra ID interactive authentication (browser/device flow). PATs are explicitly NOT supported.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Multi-instance pattern**: Run separate MCP server instances per org with unique names:
  ```json
  "ado-microsoft": { "args": ["@azure-devops/mcp", "microsoft"] }
  "ado-msazure": { "args": ["@azure-devops/mcp", "msazure"] }
  ```
- Tools become prefixed: `ado-microsoft-core_list_projects` vs `ado-msazure-core_list_projects`
- Both orgs accessible simultaneously without context switching

**Alternative Considered:**
- Az CLI fallback with `--org` flags (rejected: CLI is slower, less structured, and was failing in test environment)
- Dynamic config swapping (rejected: no runtime reload capability)

**Recommendation:** Always use multi-instance MCP setup for any cross-org ADO work. Document org routing in Squad skills.

**Decision Status:** ✅ Merged to `.squad/decisions.md` (Decision 14) on 2026-03-11. Multi-instance MCP pattern approved for team adoption.
