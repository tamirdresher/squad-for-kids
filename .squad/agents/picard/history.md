## Learnings

### 2026-03-02: idk8s-infrastructure Deep Architecture Analysis

**Context:** Tasked with deep-diving into the idk8s-infrastructure Azure DevOps repository (project "One", msazure org) to extend existing architecture report. Repository access via MCP tools failed - project "One" not found, searches for "idk8s-infrastructure" returned zero results.

**Technical Learnings:**

1. **Repository Discovery Limitations:**
   - Azure DevOps MCP tools require exact project name and repository name
   - Organization name must also be correct (msazure assumed, but may be different)
   - Search functionality has limited scope across organizations
   - Lesson: Always verify full repository path: `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_git/{repo}`

2. **Gap Analysis as Deliverable:**
   - When primary data source (repo) is inaccessible, analyzing existing documentation for gaps provides high value
   - Identified 10 major architectural knowledge gaps in the existing report
   - Created actionable investigation plan for when access is obtained
   - Lesson: "What's missing" analysis can be as valuable as "what's there" analysis

3. **Architecture Report Quality Indicators:**
   - Missing ADR content (beyond titles) is a red flag for incomplete architectural documentation
   - Configuration flow tracing (source → build → deploy → runtime) is often overlooked but critical
   - Cross-repository dependency mapping is essential for understanding blast radius
   - Vision/roadmap documents provide strategic context that technical docs cannot

4. **Azure DevOps vs GitHub Context:**
   - If repository is actually on GitHub, completely different MCP tools are needed (github-mcp-server-*)
   - User's assumption of "Azure DevOps" may not match reality
   - Lesson: Confirm repository platform before deep analysis

**Architectural Insights from Report Analysis:**

1. **Strengths Identified:**
   - Strong Kubernetes-inspired patterns (reconciliation, desired-state, scheduler)
   - Clean separation of concerns (MP, ResourceProvider, Inventory, Reconcilers)
   - Mature multi-tenancy with namespace isolation and resource quotas
   - Sophisticated 4-layer health management system

2. **Concerns Identified:**
   - ConfigMap as persistent store is interim solution with scalability limits (1MB, no indexing, weak concurrency)
   - Windows containers for Management Plane (5-10x larger than Linux, slower)
   - NuGet package distribution for core logic creates versioning coordination challenges
   - Celestial CLI "not in active use" suggests weak local dev story
   - 19 hardcoded tenants in Data/Tenants/ doesn't scale beyond ~20

3. **Red Flags:**
   - ADRs 0001-0003 missing (foundational decisions lost)
   - No disaster recovery plan mentioned
   - No capacity planning guidance
   - EV2 endpoints (/validate, /suspend, /cancel) not implemented (returning 501)

**Decision Pattern:**
- **When blocked on primary data source:** Deliver gap analysis and investigation plan rather than blocking
- **Gap categories that matter most:**
  1. Strategic (vision, roadmap, deprecation timelines)
  2. Operational (DR, capacity planning, observability)
  3. Architectural reasoning (full ADR content, alternatives considered)
  4. Integration (cross-repo dependencies, external services)
  5. Configuration lifecycle (source to runtime tracing)

**Actions for User:**
- Requested full repository URL verification
- Provided 6-day investigation plan for when access is obtained
- Documented 10 specific architectural gaps to investigate

## Cross-Session Learning: Azure DevOps Access Limitations

**Important for all future sessions with this team:**

All five agents (Picard, B'Elanna, Worf, Data, Seven) encountered the same Azure DevOps access limitation during 2026-03-02 idk8s-deep-analysis session:

- **Problem:** Azure DevOps project "One" in msazure organization not found via API tools
- **Impact:** Unable to access idk8s-infrastructure repository directly
- **Root Causes (suspected):**
  1. Project name "One" may be incorrect or abbreviated
  2. Repository may be in different Azure DevOps organization
  3. Repository may be on GitHub, not Azure DevOps
  4. API connection may have incorrect credentials or limited permissions
  
- **Unblocking Strategy:**
  - User must verify and provide: Full Azure DevOps URL `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_git/{repo}` OR GitHub org/repo URL
  - Confirm API user has Code (Read) permissions
  - Once unblocked, all agents can re-run their analyses with full repository access

- **What Was Delivered Despite Limitation:**
  - Gap analysis of existing architecture report (Picard)
  - Infrastructure pattern inference (B'Elanna)
  - Security architecture analysis (Worf)
  - Code pattern inference (Data)
  - Repository health assessment (Seven)
  
- **What Will Require Unblocking:**
  - Direct code inspection and metrics
  - CI/CD pipeline analysis
  - Repository activity metrics (commits, branches, PRs)
  - SAST security scanning
  - API contract validation

**Action:** Before spawning agents for future idk8s-infrastructure tasks, verify and document correct repository location.
