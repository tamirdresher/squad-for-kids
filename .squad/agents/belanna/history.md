## Learnings

<!-- Append learnings below -->

### 2026-03-02: idk8s-infrastructure Deep-Dive Analysis

**Task:** Infrastructure layer analysis of Identity Kubernetes Platform (Celestial) fleet management system.

**Challenge:** Repository not directly accessible via Azure DevOps MCP tools (project "One", repo "idk8s-infrastructure" not found). Conducted analysis based on architectural report and infrastructure patterns.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Helm Chart Strategy:**
   - Tenant workload charts stored in ACR (Azure Container Registry)
   - OPA/Rego policy validation pre-deployment
   - Chart resolution via `Library/HelmArtifactRegistry/`
   - Values schema includes: tenant/service identity, resources, Azure resources (KeyVault, Storage), monitoring (Geneva)

2. **Kubernetes Manifest Organization:**
   - **Two deployment axes:** Cluster infrastructure (Component Deployer) + Tenant workloads (Management Plane)
   - Component manifests with dependency resolution, topology selectors (clusterTypes, regions, clouds)
   - Namespace isolation per scale unit: `{tenant}-{service}-{cloud}-{region}-{seq}`

3. **Bicep/ARM Templates:**
   - Located in `src/bicep/`
   - Provisions: AKS clusters, managed identities, KeyVault, Storage, Traffic Manager
   - SKU standardization: Dds_v6/Dads_v6 (ADR-0009)
   - Multi-cloud parameterization: Public, Fairfax, Mooncake, BlackForest, USNat, USSec

4. **Deployment Pipelines:**
   - Docker build → ACR
   - Helm package → ACR (OCI registry)
   - EV2 spec generation (ServiceModel, RolloutSpec, ScopeBindings)
   - Progressive rings: Test → PPE → Production
   - Tag-based releases (ADR-0007)

5. **EV2 Configuration:**
   - **Cluster Orchestrator pattern (ADR-0006):** Each cluster = separate EV2 stamp
   - ServiceModel: HTTP extensions calling Management Plane API
   - RolloutSpec: Orchestration steps with dependencies, parallel actions within rings
   - ScopeBindings: Azure subscription/resource group mappings per cloud

6. **Cluster Configuration:**
   - ClusterRegistry maintains inventory across 7 cloud environments
   - Cluster types: Generic, DPX, Gateway, MP
   - Node pools: System (K8s components), User (tenant workloads)
   - Topology filtering + scheduler scoring (Filter-Score-Select pattern)

7. **Component Manifests:**
   - YAML declarations with `kind`, `dependencies`, `topology` selectors
   - Plugin-based execution: HelmPlugin, ManifestPlugin, DaemonSetPlugin
   - Deployment order via topological sort with parallel batches
   - AOS components: NodeHealthAgent, NodeRepairService, RemediationController, PodHealthCheckService, pod-health-api-controller

**Infrastructure Patterns Identified:**
- Kubernetes operator patterns in C# (reconciliation loops, desired-state)
- Scale unit scheduler (Kubernetes scheduler pattern: Filter → Score → Select)
- Node health lifecycle with Azure VMSS integration (ADR-0012)
- Multi-cloud abstraction (Entra ID vs. dSTS, KeyVault vs. dSMS)

**Deliverable:** Comprehensive 48KB infrastructure analysis report (`analysis-belanna-infrastructure.md`) covering all 7 focus areas: Helm charts, K8s manifests, Bicep templates, pipelines, EV2 config, cluster definitions, component manifests.

**Recommendation:** Direct repository access would enable validation of architectural patterns and provide concrete artifact examples for future reference.

## Cross-Session Learning: Azure DevOps Access Limitations

**Important for all future sessions with this team:**

All five agents (Picard, B'Elanna, Worf, Data, Seven) encountered the same Azure DevOps access limitation during 2026-03-02 idk8s-deep-analysis session:

- **Problem:** Azure DevOps project "One" in msazure organization not found via API tools
- **Impact:** Unable to access idk8s-infrastructure repository directly
- **Root Causes (suspected):**
  1. Project name "One" may be incorrect or abbreviated
  2. Repository may be in different Azure DevOps organization
  3. Repository may be on GitHub, not Azure DevOps
  4. API connection may have incorrect credentials or limited permissions
  
- **Unblocking Strategy:**
  - User must verify and provide: Full Azure DevOps URL `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_git/{repo}` OR GitHub org/repo URL
  - Confirm API user has Code (Read) permissions
  - Once unblocked, all agents can re-run their analyses with full repository access

- **What Was Delivered Despite Limitation:**
  - Gap analysis of existing architecture report (Picard)
  - Infrastructure pattern inference (B'Elanna)
  - Security architecture analysis (Worf)
  - Code pattern inference (Data)
  - Repository health assessment (Seven)
  
- **What Will Require Unblocking:**
  - Direct code inspection and metrics
  - CI/CD pipeline analysis
  - Repository activity metrics (commits, branches, PRs)
  - SAST security scanning
  - API contract validation

**Action:** Before spawning agents for future idk8s-infrastructure tasks, verify and document correct repository location.
